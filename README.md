# Blanc
### A Picross Christmas Game for the [KuriusHacks GameJam CE 2021](https://www.kurius.ca/kuriushacks-ce)
Created by Catriona Nguyen, Giovanna Gerada, Madeline Ahn, Peter Trinh, 2021.


## Background
“Blanc” is a Christmas-themed puzzle game created for the KuriusHacks GameJam CE 2021, winning the **First Place Jury Prize**. The game is based on the 1942 song “White Christmas”, by Bing Crosby. It tells the story of Tim, who — after his grandmother passes away — struggles to experience the joy of Christmas. He remembers fond Christmas memories of the past and sets out to recreate them. By completing nonogram puzzles of varying difficulty, the player will fill the void in Tim’s life and reintroduce the spirit of Christmas to him once again.

***“I’m dreaming of a White Christmas, just like the ones I used to know.”***
